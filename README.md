<center> <h1>HBNB - The Console</h1> </center>

This repository contains the initial stage of a student project to build a clone of the AirBnB website. This stage implements a backend interface, or console, to manage program data. Console commands allow the user to create, update, and destroy objects, as well as manage file storage. Using a system of JSON serialization/deserialization, storage is persistent between sessions.

<center> <h2>General Use</h2> </center>

1. First clone this repository.

3. Once the repository is cloned locate the "console.py" file and run it as follows:
```
/AirBnB_clone$ ./console.py
```
4. When this command is run the following prompt should appear:
```
(hbnb)
```
5. This prompt designates you are in the "HBnB" console. There are a variety of commands available within the console program.

##### Commands
    * create - Creates an instance based on given class

    * destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID

    * show - Shows an object based on class and UUID

    * all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class

    * update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID

    * quit - Exits the program (EOF will as well)


##### Alternative Syntax
Users are able to issue a number of console command using an alternative syntax:

	Usage: <class_name>.<command>([<id>[name_arg value_arg]|[kwargs]])
Advanced syntax is implemented for the following commands: 

    * all - Shows all objects the program has access to, or all objects of a given class

	* count - Return number of object instances by class

    * show - Shows an object based on class and UUID

	* destroy - Destroys an object based on class and UUID

    * update - Updates existing attributes an object based on class name and UUID

- What is **kwargs and how to use it.
- How to handle named arguments in a function.
- How to create a MySQL database.

- How to handle 2 different storage engines with the same codebase.
- How to use environment variables.
## Project Description
The Airbnb clone is one of the main projects at ALX SE Program, it's a long term project that we need to accomplish by building up trough a series of small modules or pieces. This project is thinking as a whole for a software developer, to learn and become a full-stack developer, gluing alltogether the infrastructure of the Airbnb from back to front, including databases, static and dynamic content, web frameworks, APIs, and web infrastructure. The first step that we need to build is "the console" or the command interpreter, this is meant to be a tool to validate or manipulate the storage system, through the console we are gonna be able of:

- Create our data model.
- Manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects.
- Store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)

This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”.

You can find this in: AirBnB clone - The console

For the second part of the project we should build the database connection through SQLAlchemy, the ORM of Python.

Using a MySQL storage we replace the file storage (JSON file) by a Database storage and we map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.

## Directory Files Description
